# data_engineering_case_study

I have completed the Data Engineering Case Study as per the requirements provided. The solution includes:

Data Ingestion System: Implemented a scalable data ingestion system capable of collecting and processing ad impressions (JSON), clicks/conversions (CSV), and bid requests (Avro) data in real-time and batch modes.

Data Processing: Developed data transformation processes to standardize and enrich the data, handle validation, filtering, deduplication, and correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions.

Data Storage and Query Performance: Selected an appropriate data storage solution for efficient storage and fast querying of processed data for campaign performance analysis. Optimized the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations.

Error Handling and Monitoring: Created an error handling and monitoring system to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays, and implemented alerting mechanisms to address data quality issues in real-time.
